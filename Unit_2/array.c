#include <stdio.h>

//in arrays all the values contained are of the same type (array = data structure)
//in order to enter to the values contained in an array we could do the following array_name[index], being the index(i) the locations of the values inside
//an array and it starts from 0 till the last number of values stored in the array (lenght minus 1)

// specifying the lenght of an array using macro is considered excellent practice, example: #define N 10    int arr[N];
//we could also designate a specific index for a specific value, for example: int arr[]:{[1] = 90, [2] = 70};
// there is also a certain advantage of not specifiying the lenght of tha array since we could store the amount of values that we desire at any point 

// now for the bubble sort:
